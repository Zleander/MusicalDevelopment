This repository looks at the change of music over time. 
Specifically it looks at the Spotify audio features of the dataset that
can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs) (last accessed 03.02.22).

The pdf of the report is the "doc/" directory

## Abstract:
As part of their API, Spotify offers _audio features_ for all their songs. In this report we use a dataset containing said audio features of just over 1.2 million songs to _predict the release year_ from them with regression models. We then look at the resulting coefficients and try to draw conclusions, _how these features developed over time_.
